Part 2:

I use automated browsing to visit the https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html . I scape table from the website into pandas dataframe.

I analyse your dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:
* How many months exist on Mars?
* How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
* What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? Plot the results as a bar chart.
* Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? Plot the results as a bar chart.
* how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
